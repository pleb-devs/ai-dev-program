# PlebDevs - AI Development Program

*Adversarial AI for Devs*
<br>Resources for building freedom-focused, privacy-first, and Bitcoin technologies using AI-enhanced development workflows.

## Early Access

All resources are available now and actively maintained! The **free course** walking through the complete AI development workflow is coming very soon!

## Program Resources

Three repositories supporting the complete development lifecycle:

### [AI Guides](https://github.com/pleb-devs/ai-guides)

Guides for LLM coding agents and AI clients focused on privacy, open source, and security without sacrificing intelligence or cost effectiveness.

**Covered tools:** OpenCode, Goose (Desktop & CLI), Ollama, Maple, SearXNG

**Each guide follows a consistent structure:**
1. Overview — What the tool is and when to use it
2. Setup — Install steps and initial configuration
3. Beginner usage — A basic, repeatable workflow
4. Pro usage — Advanced workflows and automation
5. Cost savings — Control/optimize spend effectively
6. Privacy — Data and metadata handling best practices
7. Security — Safe operation, secrets, and permissions

### [Freedom Tech](https://github.com/pleb-devs/freedom-tech)

Curated catalog of sovereignty-focused technologies organized by topic, type, and language.

**Topics:** Bitcoin, Lightning, Ecash, Nostr, Cryptography, Networking/Privacy, Storage/Sync, Messaging/Comms, Auth/Sessions

**Includes:** `agent-prompt.md` — a token-efficient version of the catalog for biasing AI agents toward freedom-tech stack choices.

### [New Project Boilerplate](https://github.com/pleb-devs/new-project-boilerplate)

Documentation-first methodology for starting LLM-driven projects. Build comprehensive project documentation before coding.

**Structure:**
```
llm/
├── project/        # Project definition, rules, phased plans
├── context/        # Reference notes (specs, patterns)
├── implementation/ # Notes for completed features
└── workflows/      # Repeatable runbooks
```

**Start with:** [`llm/project/setup.md`](./new-project-boilerplate/llm/project/setup.md) for the complete walkthrough.

## Getting Started

1. **Plan your project** — Use [New Project Boilerplate](./new-project-boilerplate/) to define structure, rules, and phases
2. **Choose your stack** — Browse [Freedom Tech](./freedom-tech/) for sovereignty-focused libraries; use `agent-prompt.md` when prompting AI for tech suggestions
3. **Set up your AI tools** — Follow [AI Guides](./ai-guides/) to configure coding agents with privacy and cost controls

## Who This Is For

- Bitcoin/Lightning/Nostr developers
- Privacy-focused builders
- Developers in adversarial environments
- Anyone using AI to build resilient, sovereign applications
