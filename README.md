# PlebDevs - AI Development Program

Empowering individuals building adversarial, freedom, and Bitcoin technologies with AI-enhanced development tools, resources, and mentorship.

## Mission

The PlebDevs AI Development Program provides technical scaffolding for developers building in adversarial environments or working on freedom-focused technologies. By leveraging AI and LLM-driven development workflows, we help builders create secure, resilient applications and tools.

## Program Status

üöß **Under Construction** - This program is actively being developed and expanded. The resources available now represent the initial foundation, with comprehensive guides, tutorials, and tools being continuously added. What you see here is the beginning of a growing ecosystem designed to support freedom technology builders.

## Program Resources

This program consists of three core resource repositories designed to support the complete development lifecycle:

### ü§ñ [AI Guides](./ai-guides/)
Comprehensive guide for choosing and evaluating AI development tools based on pricing, power, and trustworthiness.
- AI tool comparison matrix (cost vs capability vs trust)
- LLM and coding agent recommendations
- Security and privacy considerations for AI tools
- Guidance for selecting tools

### üõ°Ô∏è [Freedom Tech](./freedom-tech/)
Curated list of secure, adversarial, and freedom-focused technologies, packages, and libraries for building sovereign applications.
- Secure communication protocols
- Privacy-preserving technologies
- Decentralized infrastructure tools
- Censorship-resistant platforms

### üöÄ [New Project Boilerplate](./new-project-boilerplate/)
Documentation-first development methodology with boilerplate prompts, templates, and processes for building LLM-driven applications.
- Systematic project setup workflows
- AI-optimized development patterns
- Security-focused development guidelines
- Iterative development methodologies

## Getting Started

1. **Define Your Project**: Start with the [New Project Boilerplate](./new-project-boilerplate/) to establish your project foundation
2. **Choose Your Stack**: Explore [Freedom Tech](./freedom-tech/) for secure, privacy-focused technology recommendations
3. **Implement with AI**: Use [AI Guides](./ai-guides/) to leverage LLM-powered development workflows
4. **Build Securely**: Follow established patterns for building in adversarial environments

## Who This Is For

- **Bitcoin developers** building on Lightning, Nostr, and other Bitcoin technologies
- **Privacy-focused builders** creating secure communication and coordination tools
- **Developers** working in adversarial or censored environments
- **Freedom tech builders** focused on decentralized, sovereign technologies
- **Anyone** interested in AI-enhanced development for building resilient applications

## Support & Community

This program provides:
- **Hands-on mentorship** and development assistance
- **Security reviews** and code audits
- **AI-powered development** workflows and tools
- **Community support** through the PlebDevs network

## About PlebDevs

PlebDevs is a developer education community that has reached over 1,000 students across 60+ countries through Bitcoin-focused courses, workshops, and guides. Our mission is to make building adversarial and freedom technologies not just possible, but sustainable, secure, and empowering.
